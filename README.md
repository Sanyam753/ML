# ML
Dataset preparation: We used Roboflow to pre-process and augment the dataset. This can involve resizing, cropping, rotating, and adding variations to the images to increase the model's robustness.
Model training: Utilize TensorFlow to train the chosen model on your prepared dataset. This involves feeding the labeled images into the model and optimizing the model to minimize the recognition errors.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation data or a separate test set. Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's ability to recognize multiple objects accurately.
